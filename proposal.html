                We want to develop an application that aims to help users better utilize their wardrobe and have an easier time when picking out their daily outfits. In this day and age, there are a vast number of new and resurfacing fashion trends. This combined with the various levels of formality and occasion (work, school, exercise, daytime activities, nighttime activities) and turbulent weather may make choosing what to wear a complicated task. This app can help users have a better understanding of what is in their closet and available to them, and may help them with categorizing their wardrobe by occasion, weather, activity, etc.

                Some issues within the world of fashion that are beginning to be addressed more are the topics of sustainable clothing use and avoiding fast fashion. Making sure that neglected clothes are reused, donated, or repurposed is better for the environment than throwing them away and shopping for something to replace it. We can implement features in our app to show what clothing items have not been worn in a long time, suggesting new outfits to be made with those items, and also showing donation sites near the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                One existing attempt to solve this problem is OpenWardrobe Outfit Planner. They have existing ways to plan outfits, receive suggestions, and look for fashion inspiration. Some of our ideas for features such as pushing sustainability and highlighting use of the entire closet are not included in this existing solution.
