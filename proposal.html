                We want to develop an application that aims to help users better utilize their wardrobe and have an easier time when picking out their daily outfits. In this day and age, there are a vast number of new and resurfacing fashion trends. This combined with the various levels of formality and occasion (work, school, exercise, daytime activities, nighttime activities) and turbulent weather may make choosing what to wear a complicated task. This app can help users have a better understanding of what is in their closet and available to them, and may help them with categorizing their wardrobe by occasion, weather, activity, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some issues within the world of fashion that are beginning to be addressed more are the topics of sustainable clothing use and avoiding fast fashion. Making sure that neglected clothes are reused, donated, or repurposed is better for the environment than throwing them away and shopping for something to replace it. We can implement features in our app to show what clothing items have not been worn in a long time, suggesting new outfits to be made with those items, and also showing donation sites near the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                One existing attempt to solve this problem is OpenWardrobe Outfit Planner. They have existing ways to plan outfits, receive suggestions, and look for fashion inspiration. Some of our ideas for features such as pushing sustainability and highlighting use of the entire closet are not included in this existing solution.

                App Description
            </h2>
            <p>
                The application is designed for a group of people who are interested in fashion and also environmentally conscious. They would like to dress well, and find interesting styles, however, at the same time feel guilty about buying new clothes every time. They would like to participate in environmental activities, meanwhile lacking time and resources. The appâ€™s purpose is to facilitate an engagement-friendly activity with their interest, which is fashion, integrating into daily life. Expected outcomes include a collective advancement toward a more sustainable environment, potentially benefiting communities that are most affected by ecological challenges.
            </p>

                Using the app, users will engage with several interactive features designed to maximize their clothing utilization and enhance their fashion experience:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wardrobe Upload and Tagging: </strong> Users can upload images and details of their clothes, tagging them by type, color, occasion, etc. After the user uploads the new clothes, it reloads the updated wardrobe data for the users. This digital wardrobe keeps track of what items they own and how often they're worn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Outfit Mix and Match: </strong>An interactive feature where users can combine uploaded clothing items to visualize potential outfits. Users can use the filtering or search engine to find the matching clothes and after it has been chosen, it will put together looks virtually.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wear or Donate Notification: </strong>The app will analyze clothing usage and alert users when items haven't been worn for a set period. It will suggest wearing the item or considering donating it, also offering styling tips to encourage use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Community Outfit Sharing (Half Feature): </strong>A social feature where users can post their outfits and view combinations from others, encouraging community interaction and fashion inspiration.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The app primarily utilizes users uploading pictures of their clothes along with tags and descriptive information for each item. It also utilizes outfit ideas shared by users to enhance its offerings. For initial content and to demonstrate its features, the app may incorporate data from existing fashion datasets, like the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/visuelle" target="_blank">Visuelle database</a> or <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset" target="_blank">Product Images Dataset from Kaggle</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This app addresses the problem of unused clothing and the environmental and personal cost of constantly purchasing new items. Providing users with a tool to explore their existing wardrobe thoroughly, encourages more frequent use of every clothes they own. This not only saves time and reduces the impulse to buy more but also promotes sustainability by extending the life of clothing. Alerting users to items they haven't worn in a while suggests opportunities for donation or reuse, further enhancing the app's practical and eco-friendly benefits.
